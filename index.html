                <h1>Shahan Shahid Nawaz</h1>
                <p>I am a Data Scientist passionate about solving exciting problems through Data Science and Data Visualization.
                </p>
                <p>I hold a BSc (Hons.) Economics from the Lahore University of Management Sciences and the <a href="https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/programs/mims" target="_blank">Master of
                        Information Management &amp; Systems</a> from UC Berkeley's School of Information for which I
                    studied Data Analysis, Machine Learning, and Data Visualization. </p>
                <p>I currently work at the World Bank Group as a HR Data Analyst.</p>
                    <p>In the past, I served as a Graduate Student Researcher and then Data Scientist Researcher at the
                    Othering and Belonging Institute's <a href="https://belonging.berkeley.edu/equity-metrics"
                        target="_blank">Equity Metrics team</a> where I used Geospatial Data Science (R, Python) to tackle questions of
                    housing affordability and inclusivity including a statewide analysis of the extent and impact of <a
                        href="https://belonging.berkeley.edu/single-family-zoning-california-statewide-analysis"
                        target="_blank">single-family zoning</a> in California.
                </p>
                <p>Before that, I was based in Hong Kong as a Research Analyst at <a href="https://caps.org/"
                        target="_blank">Centre for Asian Philanthropy and Society</a> and helped produce <a
                        href="https://caps.org/work/our-research_doing-good-index-2020">cross-regional and
                        one-of-a-kind</a> data analysis spanning 18 Asian economies.</p> 
                    <p></p>Even before that, I worked under eminent economists as a Data Analyst at the Cente for Economic Research in Pakistan (CERP) helping implement a <a href="https://www.cerp.org.pk/project/tax-and-public-services"
                        target="_blank">randomized
                        controlled trial in Pakistan </a> (113,000 households spread
                    across
                    two metropoles: Lahore and Faisalabad) aimed at mending the citizen-state
                    social contract.

                    extension; steered a culture of data visualisation by leading 4 bi-weekly company-wide data
                    visualization discussions; and authored a data-viz focused organisational plan to differentiate
                    Breakwater Strategy in the industry. This blogpost (linked) received 3500+ impressions.</a>
