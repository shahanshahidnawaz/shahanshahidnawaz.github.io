                <h1>Shahan Shahid Nawaz</h1>
                <p>I am a Data Scientist passionate about solving exciting problems, and data visualization.
                </p>
                <p>I hold the <a href="https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/programs/mims" target="_blank">Master of
                        Information Management &amp; Systems</a> from UC Berkeley's School of Information for which
                    I
                    studied Machine Learning and Data Visualization. I
                    served as a Data Scientist Researcher at the
                    Othering and Belonging Institute's <a href="https://belonging.berkeley.edu/equity-metrics"
                        target="_blank">Equity Metrics team</a> where I used data science to tackle questions of
                    inclusivity including a statewide analysis of the extent and impact of <a
                        href="https://belonging.berkeley.edu/single-family-zoning-california-statewide-analysis"
                        target="_blank">single-family zoning</a> in California.
                </p>
                <p>Also during my master's, I built several Data Science projects involving Machine Learning,
                    Dimensionality Reduction in Python (pandas, scikit-learn), and Spatial Analysis (R, Python
                    (geopandas)); coded Arduino hardware to build a smart scent diffuser;
                    learnt swimming; and studied Punjabi in the Gurmukhi script.
                <p>
                <p>Before that, I was based in Hong Kong between 2018 and 2020 as the <a href="https://caps.org/"
                        target="_blank">Centre for Asian Philanthropy and Society</a>'s main data
                    resource and helped produce <a
                        href="https://caps.org/work/our-research_doing-good-index-2020">cross-regional and
                        one-of-a-kind</a> data analysis. From 2015-2018, I worked under eminent economists helping
                    implement a <a href="https://www.cerp.org.pk/project/tax-and-public-services"
                        target="_blank">randomized
                        controlled trial in Pakistan </a> (113,000 households spread
                    across
                    two metropoles: Lahore and Faisalabad) aimed at mending the citizen-state
                    social contract.
                </p>
                </p>
                <p>I am available to discuss collaborations or professional opportunities.

                    extension; steered a culture of data visualisation by leading 4 bi-weekly company-wide data
                    visualization discussions; and authored a data-viz focused organisational plan to differentiate
                    Breakwater Strategy in the industry. This blogpost (linked) received 3500+ impressions.</a>
